# Dress Machine
Dress Machine is a piece about movement. Specifically, the invisible movements that sit behind items we touch every day.

While a finished piece of clothing hangs out-of-reach nearby, you sit in the place of a factory worker, going through the motions of apparel production. Created with Arduino.
